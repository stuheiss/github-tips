## Tips on github usage

### Update your fork directly from GitHub:

- see: http://www.hpique.com/2013/09/updating-a-fork-directly-from-github/

1. Open your fork on GitHub.
2. Click on Pull Requests.
3. Click on New Pull Request. By default, GitHub will compare the original with your fork, and there shouldn’t be anything to compare if you didn’t make any changes.
4. Click on switching the base. Now GitHub will compare your fork with the original, and you should see all the latest changes.
5. Click on Click to create a pull request for this comparison and assign a predictable name to your pull request (e.g., Update from original).
6. Click on Send pull request.
7. Scroll down and click Merge pull request and finally Confirm merge. If your fork didn’t have any changes, you will be able to merge it automatically.
